A lightweight, minimal, plug and play boilerplate. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the client, tied together with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and themed with [Blossom](https://getblossom.io/).

## Features
### Client and server
Combines an environment of both a client, powered by React, and a server, powered by Express.

### Router ready
Start building your pages by creating your routes in React. The boilerplate is using the latest version of React so make sure you're up to date with the latest trends.

### Instant feedback
Hot reloading on both the client and server means you can spend more time on getting that project a step further. Save changes on the client to get them streamed straight into your browser. Same goes for style changes done in the Blossom environment. Changes to the server directory will need a hard reload to take effect.

### Modular design
Split into modular client and server directories, its dead easy to set up from scratch or plug in another project.

### Style ready
Fully embedded Stylus ecosystem with plugins backed up by the [Blossom UI](https://getblossom.io) framework.
